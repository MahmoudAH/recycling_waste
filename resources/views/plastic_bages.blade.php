    <h3>How To Recycle</h3>
     <p>The average American generates 4.4 pounds of trash per day, adding to the grand total of about 258 million tons of trash the United States accumulates per year. American communities recycled and composted nearly 35% of municipal solid waste in 2014, diverting 89 million tons to recovery according to
     the U.S. EPA. Use the "Recycling Explorer" below to learn what to recycle and how.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;font-size: 30px">What is it used for?</h2>
        <p>Retail bags, dry cleaning bags, bread bags, flexible plastic packaging from paper towels, cases of soda, cotton balls,
        or bathroom tissue; shipping pillows, sealable or “zippered” plastic food bags, etc.</p></br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px">Why it wants to be recycled.</h2>
        <p>Plastic bags and flexible wraps, also known as “film,” are recyclable and, like other plastics, can be used to make many other products.
        Recycling reduces litter, lessens the amount of waste going to landfills, and gives a valuable resource a second life.</p></br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px">How to recycle it?</h2>
        <p>Return plastic bags and films to labeled receptacles, widely available at grocery and retail outlets. Do not include food or cling wrap, prepared food bags,
        biodegradable bags or film that has been painted or has excessive glue.</p></br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px">What does recycled paper become?</h2>
        <p>Once collected, plastic bags and film are baled and sent to recycling centers. Here, the used bags are cleaned, processed and turned into flakes and pellets. The pellets are reused to make into new plastic shopping bags,
        durable outdoor fences, decks, shopping carts and home building products.</p>
