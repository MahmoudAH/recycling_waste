        <h2>What is it used for?</h2>
        <p>Food cans, aerosol cans</p></br>
        <h2>Why it wants to be recycled.</h2>
        <p>Recovered steel can be remelted and used again and again to produce new steel products. For every ton of steel recycled, 2,500 pounds of iron ore, 1,400 pounds of coal and 120 pounds of limestone are conserved.
        The energy saved by recycling is enough to power about 18 million homes for a full year.
        Recycling steel saves nearly 74% of the energy used to produce it from raw materials.
        <h2>How to recycle it?</h2>
        <p>Curbside recycling bin or local recycling drop-off or scrap buy-back center.</p></br>
        <h2>What does recycled paper become?</h2>
        <p>Steel is collected, separated from other materials by a magnet and crushed into large bales. The bales are shipped to steel mills where they are melted in a furnace to make new steel. A minimum average of 22% recycled steel goes back in to packaging, car bodies, appliances, and steel framing.
        Products such as structural sections and bridge spans use virtually 100% recycled steel.</p>
