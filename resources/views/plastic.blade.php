        <p>Once collected, mixed plastics are sorted, baled and sent to a reclaiming facility. There the plastics are cleaned, washed and ground into flakes. The flakes are dried, melted, filtered and formed into pellets. These are sent to a manufacturer to be heated and remolded into a new product.

Depending on the kind of plastic, here are just a few things recycling bottles and containers can become.
Recycled plastic can be made into new containers and packaging, fiber and fiberfill for clothing, carpeting,
car parts and strapping. Another type of plastic can be made into new containers, durable outdoor decks, benches, plastic lumber and playground equipment, and recycling bins. Some recycled plastics are made into car parts and reusable kitchenware like cutting boards,
utensils and food storage containers.</p>
