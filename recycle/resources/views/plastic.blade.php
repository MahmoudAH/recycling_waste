    <h3>How To Recycle</h3>
     <p>The average American generates 4.4 pounds of trash per day, adding to the grand total of about 258 million tons of trash the United States accumulates per year. American communities recycled and composted nearly 35% of municipal solid waste in 2014, diverting 89 million tons to recovery according to
     the U.S. EPA. Use the "Recycling Explorer" below to learn what to recycle and how.</p>

        </p></br>
        <h2  style="font-size: 30px">How to recycle it?</h2>
        <p>Curbside, school, work, or public space recycling bins or at local recycling drop-off centers. In some states, beverage containers are returnable to retail outlets or other redemption centers for a refund on the deposit paid when the beverage container was purchased.

Lotion bottles and other toiletry items with pumps: empty the contents, discard the pump, and recycle the bottle.

Other toiletry bottles: empty the contents, replace the cap, and recycle.</p></br>
        <h2  style="font-size: 30px">What does recycled paper become?</h2>
        <p>Once collected, mixed plastics are sorted, baled and sent to a reclaiming facility. There the plastics are cleaned, washed and ground into flakes. The flakes are dried, melted, filtered and formed into pellets. These are sent to a manufacturer to be heated and remolded into a new product.

Depending on the kind of plastic, here are just a few things recycling bottles and containers can become.
Recycled plastic can be made into new containers and packaging, fiber and fiberfill for clothing, carpeting,
car parts and strapping. Another type of plastic can be made into new containers, durable outdoor decks, benches, plastic lumber and playground equipment, and recycling bins. Some recycled plastics are made into car parts and reusable kitchenware like cutting boards,
utensils and food storage containers.</p>
