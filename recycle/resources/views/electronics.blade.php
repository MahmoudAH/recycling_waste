     <p>The average American generates 4.4 pounds of trash per day, adding to the grand total of about 258 million tons of trash the United States accumulates per year.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 30px">What is it used for?</h2>
        <p>More than 4.4 million tons of electronic equipment in the U.S. are recycled each year. This includes desktop and laptop computers, monitors, printers, copiers, hard drives, tablets, televisions, cell phones, digital cameras, cords,
        keyboards and ink and toner cartridges. </br> aluminum foil, and cookware</p></br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px">Why it wants to be recycled.</h2>
        <p>Recycling electronics prevents valuable material from going into the waste stream.
        Recycling reduces energy use and pollution that would be created while manufacturing new products and reduces the need to extract limited resources.
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px">How to recycle it?</h2>
        <p>There are many options for recycling e-scrap. If your cell phone, laptop, or other device is still in working condition,
        you can give it a “second life” by donating it to a school or nonprofit organization. For many handheld devices
        there are mail-in donation programs. Another option is to return your e-scrap to the manufacturer or retailer.
        Many companies refurbish electronic devices for resale. Look for e-scrap collection events in your community — they may be
        organized as fundraisers for local schools or charities, or happen around America Recycles Day or Earth Day.
        When recycling such things as phones and computers, always clear your personal data.
        You can find out how by asking the manufacturer or using an R2 Solutions certified recycling company.</p></br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px">What does recycled electronics  become?</h2>
        <p>Electronics contain valuable precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper, tin and zinc. These are recovered and used in a number of ways, including jewelry, plating, new electronics and automotive parts.
        Plastic components can be used in new electronic devices or other plastic products such as garden furniture.</p>
